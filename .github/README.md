In the void of space, your blood will boil before you freeze to death![^1]

- Ad Astra-accurate base temperatures for each planet (and their orbits)
- Oxygen distributor stabilizes world temperature
- Space Suit provides full cold dampening and some heat dampening when it has oxygen (must wear full suit)
- Netherite Space Suit and Jet Suit provide full temperature dampening when they have oxygen (must wear full suit)

**Please disable temperature damage in the Ad Astra config.** This mod intends to replace Ad Astra's temperature system with Cold Sweat.
```json
// Disables temperature damage.
"disableTemperature": true,
```
